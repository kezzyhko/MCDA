# Multiple-criteria decision analysis

An old school project hosted here for history purposes. The .exe file in release might work only on Russian locale. What can I say, I did this in 2018 in a language I did not know at the time :)

This program helps you make a choice by selecting criterias and pairwise comparing which ones are more important.

There is presentation and description of the project [in this folder](/docs) (Russian only, sorry)
